    <h2>Background Information on Dam Data</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        This data is provided by the United States Bureau of Reclamation for free to the public on the USBR website. It was previously available in the USBR Project Data Book. Since the Bureau of Reclamation manages the planning, building, and maintenance of all government dams, the data is collected and recorded as the projects progress. Data such as location, structural dimensions, and project name are recorded. This data is significant for outside parties such as water users who are impacted by dams, engineers and students looking to learn about hydropower, and legistlators making critical decisions about dams. While the data is regulated by the Burea of Reclamation, a federal agency, their website does state that because of structural and naming alterations the data may not be accurate.
